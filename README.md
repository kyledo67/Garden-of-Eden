# Garden of Eden

**Garden of Eden** is a website designed and developed for the TSA WebMaster competition. The project explores the concept of a vegetarian restaurant that promotes sustainability through a farm-to-table approach. It highlights how such a business model can contribute to addressing issues like biodiversity loss, while also offering a clean and engaging user experience for customers.

The site was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and was submitted for evaluation at both regional and state levels of competition.
