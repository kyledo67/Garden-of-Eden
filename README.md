# Garden of Eden

**Garden of Eden** is a website designed and developed for the Regionals Webmaster competition alongside 2 friends. It won 3rd in regionals and advanced to state. The prompt was to make a vegetarian restaurant that incorporates a farm-to-table approach.

You might be wondering why the folder structure is so egregious, but at this time, we did not know how GitHub worked, nor how full-stack applications worked. We just submitted a bare MVP, and it was granted access to participate in this competition. We continued to add on and incorporate from our original MVP structure, and we submitted it and it came out like this. Programming in this environment was the most fun I've ever had making a "frontend" application.

## Project Goals
- Make a cool website.
- Emphasize the importance of biodiversity and sustainable food systems.
